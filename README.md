# Folded
Folded is a puzzle vague puzzle game idea that I've not yet refined enough to be able to produce interesting puzzles

Here's an old gif of the main mechanic, ie folding paper.

Here's a newer one where I've started to add some placeholder entities, collisions using gjk and epa and a simple bezier curve editor to make levels. After playing around with this and not finding any good puzzles in there I've decided to put this project on the shelf.
